Project Overview
This project is a digital dictionary built using F#, designed to manage and search word definitions effectively. It leverages functional programming principles like immutability, first-class functions, and pattern matching to provide a robust solution for word management and querying.

Key Features
Word Management:

Add, update, and delete word definitions.
Data stored in an immutable F# Map.
Search Functionality:

Case-insensitive search for exact and partial matches.
Data Persistence:

Save and reload dictionary data in JSON/XML format.
User Interface:

Interactive Windows Forms UI for easy usage.
Buttons, input fields, and list views for seamless interaction.
Tech Stack
Language: F# (Functional Programming)
UI Framework: Windows Forms (.NET)
Data Serialization: JSON/XML
Team Contribution
This project is a collaborative effort, with team members focusing on different modules such as dictionary logic, UI, data persistence, and testing.
